**Get your AI up and running in minutes, not months.** SWIRL AI Connect is an open-source platform that simplifies AI infrastructure setup and empowers Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) without the complexity of additional tools.

### Why SWIRL AI Connect?

* **Instant AI:**  Deploy your AI solutions rapidly with built-in security controls (data compliance, firewall, granular access, etc.).
* **RAG Made Easy:** Perform Retrieval Augmented Generation directly on your data, eliminating the need for vector databases, LangChain, or LlamaIndex.
* **No Data Movement:** No ETL, re-indexing, or data movement. Work with your data where it lives.
* **Boost Productivity:**  Enhance your team's efficiency by finding information faster and streamlining workflows.

# üîé How Swirl Works

SWIRL AI Connect adapts and distributes user queries to anything with a search API - search engines, databases, noSQL engines, cloud/SaaS services, data siloes, etc. and uses Reader LLMs to re-rank the unified results *without* extracting or indexing *anything*. 

1. **Connect:**  Point SWIRL AI Connect to your data sources (databases, documents, etc.) adding in your auth/bearer token.
2. **Query:** Ask questions or provide prompts in natural language.
3. **Get Results:** SWIRL AI Connect combines powerful search with generative AI to deliver precise answers augmented by relevant context.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

* *Optional*: To enable Swirl's Real-Time Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Docker, run the following commands from the Console using a valid OpenAI API key:
``` shell
export MSAL_CB_PORT=8000
export MSAL_HOST=localhost
export OPENAI_API_KEY=‚Äò<your-OpenAI-API-key>‚Äô
```

:key: Check out [OpenAI's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/nafDyRsVnXU?si=YpvyaRvhX65vtBrb) if you don't have an OpenAI API Key.

* In MacOS or Linux, run the following command from the Console:
