# AI Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Guide

Swirl supports Real Time [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](index.md#what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-does-swirl-support-it) out of the box, using existing search engines, databases and enterprise services.

## Intended Audience

This guide details how to configure and tune Swirl (v. 3.0 or newer) to perform RAG. It is intended for use by developers and/opr system administrators with ability to configure the system to connect to services like OpenAI ChatGPT.

# Setting up RAG

1. Install Swirl 3.0 as noted in the [installation guide](TBD), including the latest UI image. TBD review this.

2. Add your OpenAI API key to the .env file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

3. If installing locally, for non-production use, change the following line in `static/api/config/default` from:

```
"webSocketConfig": {
    "url": "wss://localhost:8000/chatgpt-data"
  }
``` 

...to...

```
"webSocketConfig": {
    "url": "ws://localhost:8000/chatgpt-data"
  }
```

TBD: explain this more

4. Add the following configuration to the `page_fetch_config_json parameter` of each SearchProvider you wish to have participate in RAG:

``````
"page_fetch_config_json": {
        "cache": "false",
        "headers": {
            "User-Agent": "Swirlbot/1.0 (+http://swirl.today)"
        },
        "timeout": 10
}, 
```

Note that this configuration has already been added to the following providers:

* [European PMC](../SearchProviders/europe_pmc.json)

5. Restart Swirl: 

```
python swirl.py restart
```

6. Go to the Galaxy UI. The "Generate AI Response" switch should be "off" as shown:

![](TBD)

7. Run a search. Results appear quickly after you press the "Search" button:

![](TBD)

8. If you wish to manually select the results to RAG with, click the "Select Items" switch to make the shopping cart appear. Results that Swirl thinks should be used in RAG will be pre-checked. Check or uncheck results, and optionally sort and/or filter them.

9. Click the "Generate AI Response" switch. A spinner will appear. The RAG response will appear in 5-15 seconds :slightly_smiling_face: depending on a variety of factors.

![](TBD)

10. Verify the RAG insight you received by reviewing the citations!

## Notes

* Swirl does not recommend RAG with public web data due to difficulty extracting article content; if seeking a solution for public data please [contact Swirl](mailto:hello@swirl.today).

* The community edition of Swirl is intended to RAG with sources you can fetch without authenticating. If you need support to RAG with content from enterprise services like Microsoft 365, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Atlassian with OAUTH2 and SSO, please [contact us for information about Swirl Enterprise](mailto:hello@swirl.today) - which supports all of that, and more, out of the box.
